Hello every body!
My name is shaaheen and I really love learning and I never get bored or tired of it.
My goal for future is to become God of computer science.
For now I can work on front end development.
And I'm learning back-end besides.
Though I love working with groups on big projects but I think I will enjoy more if I can teach what I learn to more people.
I'm gonna do my best to be my best.
